# Othello
15-112 Term Project

My term project is an implementation of the classic game Othello, a two player board game. There are five game modes available - Player vs. Player, Spectate Mode (AI vs. AI), Player vs. Easy AI, Player vs. Medium AI, and Player vs. Hard AI. 

Easy AI Algorithm:  random move placement with weight matrix
Medium AI Algorithm: A* graph search with Priority Queue
Hard AI Algorithm: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning and Iterative Deepening Search

To run this project project, download the repo into a folder and simply run othello.py. No external libraries need to be used except for cmu-112-graphics.
